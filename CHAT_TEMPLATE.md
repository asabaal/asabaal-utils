## üìã **Template Message for Claude**

```
Hi Claude! I've built a tool integration bridge that gives you access to all my development tools. Here's the setup:

üåâ BRIDGE URL: http://localhost:7000
üìä STATUS: Running locally on my machine
üîß TOOLS: 39 tools auto-discovered and ready

AVAILABLE CAPABILITIES:
‚Ä¢ Document Analyzer: Analyze text for readability, word count, patterns, emails, URLs
‚Ä¢ Format Converter: Convert between CSV‚ÜîJSON, Markdown‚ÜîHTML, JSON‚ÜîXML, YAML‚ÜîJSON
‚Ä¢ CLI Tools: 21 command-line utilities for video processing, development, system management
‚Ä¢ Python Tools: 15 auto-discovered scripts and utilities

EXAMPLE REQUESTS:
‚Ä¢ "Analyze this document for readability and extract any email addresses"
‚Ä¢ "Convert this CSV data to JSON format"
‚Ä¢ "Run my system-info tool and show the results"
‚Ä¢ "First analyze this text, then convert it from markdown to HTML"

Can you connect to my bridge and help me test these tools? I'd like to see how you can use them for real work!
```

## üéØ **Alternative Shorter Message**

```
Claude, I have a local tool bridge running at http://localhost:7000 with 39 tools including document analysis, format conversion, and CLI utilities. Can you connect and show me what tools you can access?
```

## üîÑ **Follow-up Messages (After Claude Connects)**

### **Test Document Analysis:**
```
Great! Now test the document analyzer with this text:

"Hello team! Our Q4 results show 25% growth. The new product launch at https://example.com/launch exceeded expectations. Please contact manager@company.com with any questions."

I want to see word count, reading level, and any patterns you find.
```

### **Test Format Conversion:**
```
Perfect! Now test the format converter. Convert this CSV to JSON:

name,age,department
Alice Johnson,28,Engineering
Bob Smith,34,Marketing
Carol Davis,29,Engineering

Show me the conversion stats too.
```

### **Test Complex Workflow:**
```
Excellent! Now let's try a complex workflow:

1. First analyze this CSV data for patterns
2. Then convert it to JSON
3. Then analyze the JSON structure
4. Give me a complete report

CSV data:
product,price,category,in_stock
Laptop,999.99,Electronics,true
Book,15.99,Education,false
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Chat Integration**

### **Claude Says "Can't Connect"**
**You should send:**
```
The bridge might not be running. Let me check:

In terminal: ./tools/claude-tools status

If it's stopped, I'll restart it with: ./tools/claude-tools start

Bridge should be at http://localhost:7000 when running.
```

### **Claude Says "No Tools Found"**
**You should send:**
```
Let me check tool discovery:

Terminal check: ./tools/claude-tools tools

This should show 39 tools. If not, I'll run: ./tools/claude-tools demo

The bridge auto-discovers tools from my APIs, CLI tools, and Python scripts.
```

### **Slow Performance**
**You should send:**
```
Let me check bridge health:

Terminal: ./tools/claude-tools health

Most operations should be under 20ms. The demo shows typical speeds:
./tools/claude-tools demo
```
