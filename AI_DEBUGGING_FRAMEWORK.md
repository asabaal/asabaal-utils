# ü§ñ AI-Human Collaborative Debugging Framework

## The New Reality: When AI Gets Stuck

As AI coding assistants become more powerful, the debugging process fundamentally changes. Instead of debugging code line-by-line yourself, you're debugging **the AI's understanding** of the problem and guiding it to the root cause.

## üéØ The Process We Discovered

Based on our successful text cutoff debugging session, here's the proven framework:

---

## Phase 1: AI Assistance Breakdown Recognition

### üö® Signs Your AI Assistant Is Stuck:

1. **Circular Solutions**: AI keeps suggesting the same fixes
2. **Surface-Level Fixes**: Addressing symptoms, not root causes  
3. **Broad Scope Confusion**: AI starts debugging everything instead of isolating the issue
4. **Assumption Lock-in**: AI fixates on one theory and can't break free

### ‚ö° Immediate Response:
```
STOP the AI from continuing its current approach.
FORCE a complete context reset.
DEMAND step-by-step visibility with visualizations.
```

---

## Phase 2: Collaborative Deep Dive Protocol

### Step 2.1: Isolate the Minimal Failing Case
**Human Role**: Define the simplest possible test case
**AI Role**: Create the test infrastructure

```
Template:
"Let's test with just ONE word: 'test'"
"Show me the result and every intermediate step"
"I need to SEE what's happening, not just hear descriptions"
```

### Step 2.2: Visual Validation at Every Step
**Critical**: Never accept AI explanations without visual proof

```
Template:
"Show me Figure 1: The input"
"Show me Figure 2: After step X processing" 
"Show me Figure 3: The final output"
"Make each figure separate - no subplots that might have display issues"
```

### Step 2.3: Progressive Code Excavation
When the AI's understanding is wrong, dig deeper into the actual code:

```
Escalation Ladder:
1. "Test the function you think is working"
2. "Trace INTO that function to see what it actually does"  
3. "Read the source code of that function"
4. "Find the exact line that's wrong"
```

---

## Phase 3: The Teaching Moment

### üéì How to Guide AI Through Complex Debugging:

1. **Force Single-Step Focus**:
   ```
   "Let's do ONLY the first step. Don't try to solve everything."
   "Show me just this one thing working."
   ```

2. **Demand Concrete Evidence**:
   ```
   "I don't want explanations. Show me the actual pixels/data/output."
   "If you say it works, prove it with a visualization."
   ```

3. **Break Assumptions**:
   ```
   "You keep assuming X works. Let's test X specifically."
   "Forget everything we thought we knew about Y."
   ```

4. **Source Code Truth**:
   ```
   "Read the actual code for function Z."
   "What does line 123 actually calculate?"
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è The Debugging Prompt Template

Use this when your AI assistant gets stuck:

```markdown
## DEBUGGING RESET

We're debugging [PROBLEM]. You've been stuck because [OBSERVATION OF AI'S CONFUSION].

**New approach:**

1. **Minimal Test Case**: Create a test with just [SIMPLEST POSSIBLE INPUT]

2. **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Show me separate figures for:
   - Step 1: Input state
   - Step 2: After [FIRST FUNCTION] processing  
   - Step 3: After [SECOND FUNCTION] processing
   - Step 4: Final output

3. **No Assumptions**: Don't assume [WHAT AI WAS ASSUMING] works correctly.

4. **Source Code Reading**: If any step fails, read the actual source code for that function.

5. **Evidence Only**: No explanations without visual proof.

Start with ONLY Step 1. Show me the input and what you expect to see.
```

## üîÑ The Escalation Pattern We Used

Our successful debugging followed this exact escalation:

```
Level 1: "The lyric video has text cutoff" 
         ‚Üì (AI tries surface fixes)
Level 2: "Show me the actual rendered text"
         ‚Üì (AI shows the problem is deeper)  
Level 3: "Trace step-by-step through render_lyric_line"
         ‚Üì (AI finds the issue is in render_animated_text)
Level 4: "Trace INTO render_animated_text"  
         ‚Üì (AI finds the issue is in basic font rendering)
Level 5: "Trace INTO FontManager.render_text"
         ‚Üì (AI finds the issue is in height calculation)
Level 6: "Read the actual source code for that line"
         ‚Üì (AI finds line 123 uses bbox height instead of font height)
Level 7: "Fix that specific line"
         ‚Üì (SUCCESS!)
```

**Key Insight**: Each level forced the AI to go one layer deeper into the actual implementation.

## üéØ Recognition Patterns

### When AI Is Actually Helping vs. When It's Stuck:

**‚úÖ AI Is Helping:**
- Provides specific, testable steps
- Shows visual evidence
- Admits uncertainty and suggests experiments
- Traces through actual code paths

**‚ùå AI Is Stuck:**
- Repeats the same suggestions
- Makes broad, untestable claims
- Assumes components work without testing
- Fixates on one theory despite evidence

---

## üöÄ The Collaboration Sweet Spot

**Human Strengths:**
- Recognizing when AI is stuck
- Forcing focus on specific issues
- Demanding evidence over explanations
- Breaking AI out of assumption loops

**AI Strengths:**  
- Reading and understanding large codebases
- Creating visualization code quickly
- Tracing through complex execution paths
- Making precise code fixes once the issue is identified

**The Magic**: Combining human pattern recognition with AI's code analysis depth.

## üìã Reusable Debugging Checklist

When you suspect your AI assistant is stuck:

- [ ] **STOP** the current debugging approach
- [ ] **RESET** with minimal test case
- [ ] **VISUALIZE** every step with separate figures
- [ ] **CHALLENGE** AI assumptions about what works
- [ ] **ESCALATE** into source code when needed
- [ ] **TEST** the fix with original problem

## üé¨ Next: Full Pipeline Test

Now that we've fixed the root cause, let's validate the entire lyric video pipeline works correctly!

```bash
# Test 1: Short video to validate fix
create-lyric-video --audio song.mp3 --lyrics lyrics.srt --duration 10 --output test_short.mp4

# Test 2: Full video if short works  
create-lyric-video --audio song.mp3 --lyrics lyrics.srt --output test_full.mp4
```

This framework transforms debugging from "fix my code" to "debug my AI's understanding" - a crucial skill for the AI-assisted development era.
